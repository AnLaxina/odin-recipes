# odin-recipes

## Introduction
Using the fundamentals I have learned from the Odin Project so far, I am building a website 3 various recipes. These recipes are foods that are quite suitable for an outdoor backyard barbeque. However, anyone can enjoy these dishes anywhere!

## Demonstrated Skills

- Basic understanding of HTML by including images, headers, and links.
- Basic understanding of Git and its commands by using `git push`, `git commit -m`, and `git add`.
- Using appropriate HTML headers through importance rather than size.

## Self-reflection

This project was quite overwhelming for me. I needed to utilize a myriad of different tools that I have learned so far. Such as using HTML headers, lists, images, and Git commands. Furthermore, I also needed to take good practices into account. One difficulty in that regard would have to be writing Git commands in the imperative form rather than the past tense. Overall, I learned a wealth of information in web development and I hope that I continue to learn more with the Odin Project!
